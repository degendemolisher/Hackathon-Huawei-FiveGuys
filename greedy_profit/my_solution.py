        maximising lifespan is built into the main algorithm

        for starters, in theory, lifespan is maximised by:
        1. buying servers infrequently (once per generation per release date
            OR buying more servers than currently necessary, expecting demand to rise later)
        2. never overhaul the entire fleet at the same time (resets lifespan to Â¬0)
