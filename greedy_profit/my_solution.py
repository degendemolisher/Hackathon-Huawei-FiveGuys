        maximising lifespan is built into the main algorithm

        for starters, in theory, lifespan is maximised by:
        1. buying servers infrequently (once per generation per release date
            OR buying more servers than currently necessary, expecting demand to rise later)
        2. never overhaul the entire fleet at the same time (resets lifespan to Â¬0)
        3. dismissing servers as closely to the end of their lifespan as possible (above a certain threshold)
        4. [HARD] moving servers as much as possible before dismissing them
